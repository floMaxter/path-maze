# path-maze
Console application for finding the way in the maze.
The program is designed to find the path from the starting point in a maze to the end. The program assumes the presence of a discrete working field, which is a rectangle divided into separate cells. These cells can be classified as free, obstacles, the beginning of the path, and the end of the path. The path can only be laid on free cells, and it is built only in orthogonal form.
